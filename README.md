Waze Scenario Background

Waze is a free navigation app that makes it easy for drivers around the world to reach their destinations. A community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and Waze users contribute to making every journey better and safer. Waze forges partnerships with cities, transport authorities, broadcasters, businesses and first responders to help as many people as possible travel more efficiently and safely.

You will work closely with teammates at Waze to analyse and interpret data, generate valuable insights, and assist in making informed business decisions. Your team will start a new project aimed at preventing user churn on the Waze app. Churn refers to the number of users who have deleted the Waze app or stopped using it. This project will focus on monthly user churn.

The project is part of a broader effort at Waze to increase growth. A high retention rate usually indicates satisfied users who use the Waze app repeatedly over time. Developing a churn prediction model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and support Waze's business development. An accurate model can also help identify specific factors that cause churn and answer questions such as:

Who are the potential churn users?
Why do users churn?
When do users churn?
For example, if Waze can identify user segments with a high risk for churn, it can proactively engage with them through special offers to retain them. Otherwise, Waze may lose those users without knowing the reason behind their churn.

The insights you generate will assist Waze leadership in optimising the company's retention strategy, improving user experience, and making data-driven decisions on product development.

Project Background

The Waze data team is working on a churn project. Before the team can start the data analysis process, the following steps need to be taken:

Data Exploration and Cleaning: Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics and cleanliness of the data. This process involved understanding the variables and cleaning the data where necessary.

Visualisation Type Selection and Construction: Selecting the most appropriate type of visualisation to present the data effectively. The team should build visualisations that are relevant to the project objectives and the data at hand.

Creation of Plots to Visualise Variables and Relationships Between Variables: Creating graphical plots that depict relevant variables and the relationships between them. This helps in better understanding the data and possible patterns.

Sharing Results with the Data Team: After analysing the
